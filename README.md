## Description
### Part 1: Research Question

This section of the assessment covers unsupervised learning with R. 

We will revisit our last week's case study and using the learnings and the given datasets. We will be tasked to create a supervised learning model to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in the blog. 

Note that you will be required to include your last week's IP insights thus you can add a modeling section to your last week's submission submit it.  

### Part 2: Research Question

This section of the assessment covers unsupervised learning with R. 

Kira Plastinina (Links to an external site.) is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis.
